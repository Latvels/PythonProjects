- photoShort
This application is an assistant in sorting photos.
It will erase photos by the date of the first modification (usually this is the date when the photos are only created), creates a new folder with the date in the form of day.month.year.
To use, select a folder with photos and all photos in it will be sorted.
If there is another folder in the folder, then it will not go to it, but will sort exactly where you specified.
