This application is an assistant in sorting photos.<br> It will erase photos by the date of the first modification (usually this is the date when the photos are only created), creates a new folder with the date in the form of day.month.year.<br> To use, select a folder with photos and all photos in it will be sorted.<br> If there is another folder in the folder, then it will not go to it, but will sort exactly where you specified.
